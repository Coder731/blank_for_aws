# blank_for_aws

This is a complete black box
I finally figured out how to push from aws cloud9
to GitHub

It uses the 
Personal Access Token

just my simple username when prompted 
then the personal access token when prompted

but before these two authentication steps (username and PAT)
the key was to make a new repo on github
not put a readme in it

so that it was empty

then when it was created but blank

do the instructions given automatically by GitHub in the repo when it is created blank

somenthing like:

create Readme
using CLI

then

do all the commands given

and finally the command ending with .git

I think that was the push

and that that was the one where it amazingly pushed all this c9 stuff to GitHub.

Hooray!
